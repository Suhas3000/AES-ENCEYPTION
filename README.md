# AES-ENCEYPTION
A Python Tkinter GUI that demonstrates AES (CBC) encryption/decryption using PyCryptodome. Enter plaintext and a 16/24/32-char key to encrypt; view Base64 ciphertext + IV and decrypt back to plaintext. Great for learning modern crypto used in Wi-Fi, TLS, VPNs.
# üîê AES Encryption & Decryption GUI (Python + Tkinter)

A simple **Python GUI tool** to perform **AES encryption and decryption** using the **PyCryptodome library**.  
This project demonstrates how modern encryption works in real-world applications like **Wi-Fi security, SSL/TLS, and VPNs**.
